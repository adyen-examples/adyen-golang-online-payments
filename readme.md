# Adyen [online payment](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments) integration demos

## Run this integration in seconds using [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)

* Open your [Adyen Test Account](https://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/ca/overview/default.shtml) and create a set of [API keys](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-api-key).
* Go to [gitpod account variables](https://gitpod.io/variables).
* Set the `ADYEN_API_KEY`, `ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY`, `ADYEN_HMAC_KEY` and `ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT variables`.
* Click the button below!

_NOTE: To allow the Adyen Drop-In and Components to load, you have to add `https://*.gitpod.io` as allowed origin for your chosen set of [API Credentials](https://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/ca/config/api_credentials_new.shtml)_

## Details

This repository showcases a PCI-compliant integration of the [Sessions Flow](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/build-your-integration/additional-use-cases/), the default integration that we recommend for merchants. Explore this simplified e-commerce demo to discover the code, libraries and configuration you need to enable various payment options in your checkout experience.

The demo leverages Adyen's API Library for Golang ([GitHub](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-go-api-library) | [Docs](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/libraries#go)).

## Requirements

Golang 1.19+

## Installation

1. Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/adyen-examples/adyen-golang-online-payments.git
```

2. Create a `./.env` file with all required configuration

   - PORT (default 8080)
   - [API key](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-api-key)
   - [Client Key](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/client-side-authentication)
   - [Merchant Account](https://docs.adyen.com/account/account-structure)
   - [HMAC Key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks/verify-hmac-signatures)

Remember to include `http://localhost:8080` in the list of Allowed Origins

```
PORT=8080
ADYEN_API_KEY="your_API_key_here"
ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT="your_merchant_account_here"
ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY="your_client_key_here"
ADYEN_HMAC_KEY="your_hmac_key_here"
```

## Usage

1. Start the server:

```
go run -v .
```

2. Visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and select an integration type.

# Webhooks

Webhooks deliver asynchronous notifications about the payment status and other events that are important to receive and process. 
You can find more information about webhooks in [this blog post](https://www.adyen.com/knowledge-hub/consuming-webhooks).

### Webhook setup

In the Customer Area under the `Developers â†’ Webhooks` section, [create](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks/#set-up-webhooks-in-your-customer-area) a new `Standard webhook`.

A good practice is to set up basic authentication, copy the generated HMAC Key and set it as an environment variable. The application will use this to verify the [HMAC signatures](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks/verify-hmac-signatures/).

Make sure the webhook is **enabled**, so it can receive notifications.

### Expose an endpoint

This demo provides a simple webhook implementation exposed at `/api/webhooks/notifications` that shows you how to receive, validate and consume the webhook payload.

### Test your webhook

The following webhooks `events` should be enabled:

To make sure that the Adyen platform can reach your application, we have written a [Webhooks Testing Guide](https://github.com/adyen-examples/.github/blob/main/pages/webhooks-testing.md)
that explores several options on how you can easily achieve this (e.g. running on localhost or cloud).
